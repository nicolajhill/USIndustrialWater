#### Rshiny app of Historical Trends and Projections of U. S. Industrial Water Use

The R shiny app was completed as portion of our Master’s Project, evaluating the historical trends and projection of U. S. industrial water use. This work highlights the current trends and the need for better reporting and recording of industrial water use. This app acts to promote data transparency and visualization tools in planning for the future. The working R shiny app can be viewed here: https://shiny.web.duke.edu

#### This collection of files includes:
1. R Scripts:
   - ui.R and server.R files for running the app
   - Install package list if you are downloading all of the data

2.	Shapefiles of Texas, North Carolina, and IN counties
   - [State Name].(dbf, prj, shp, shx)
   - These were originally download from the American Community Survey (ACS)- Census Bureau and are used to create a choropleth maps of         the number of facilities and water use over time

3.	Datasets for all three states acquired from the state agencies in charge of collecting and recording water data. 
    - These amount of data in each dataset, including the time frame and type of data collected differs between state. Additionally, some         of the files were too large to upload to GitHub, so unused columns were deleted
    - [State Name]Data.csv
    - There is also a dataset called usgs.csv that includes the usgs estimates for each state from 1985-2010

4.	Water use projection files were also collected
    - An ARIMA model was run for Texas and a Seasonal ARIMA model was used to create the projections for Indiana and North Carolina
    - The projections were created in separate R scripts not included, but the files themselves include the water use projection along           with the error associated with 95% confidence interval. 
    - Forecast[State Name].csv
